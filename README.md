# Word and Pair Count Project

This project explores the implementation of word count and word pair (bigram) count functionalities using both Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. It demonstrates how these frameworks can process and analyze large-scale text data efficiently.

## Overview

The project includes implementations for:
1. **Word Count**: Counting the frequency of individual words in a dataset.
2. **Word Pair Count (Bigram Counting)**: Counting the occurrences of word pairs (bigrams) in a dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Hadoop**: For distributed data processing using MapReduce.
- **Apache Spark**: For fast and scalable data processing.

## Files Included

- Hadoop and Spark implementations for both word count and bigram count.
- Sample input files (`test.txt`, `localfile.txt`) for testing the functionality.
- Shell scripts to run Hadoop and Spark jobs.

## Purpose

The project serves as a practical example of utilizing big data technologies for text analysis tasks. It can be extended or adapted for more complex data processing needs.
